A herd mentality simulation is a visual or computational model that demonstrates how individuals in a group tend to conform to the behavior or decisions of the majorityâ€”often without independent analysis or reasoning. It's used in psychology, economics, behavioral science, and AI to explore decision-making, crowd behavior, or even financial markets.
